Purpose
A simple app that fetches and displays weather data using an Open Weather API.
Building this website helped to consolidate skills and knowledge needed to utilise API requests.
It was the first time I have used Bootstrap as a web design tool and I have learnt how to construct and style elements using this platform.
As a result of this work I have learnt and refined the use of basic web design techniques as well as how to integrate web API's into the site in order to access external data libraries.

Features
This site has been created keeping accessability standards in mind. It includes semantic html elements. These have been constructed in a logical structure.

User Stories
As a person who needs to plan ahead for events:
I want to be able to access weather data for specific locations.
I want to see the weather forcast for today and the next 5 days.
I want to see data for temperature, humidity, wind speed and uv rating.
I want a clear and easy to use UI.
I want my previous searches to be remembered for quick access.
